Thank you for your interest in ModePoints!

ModePoints is a simple and plugin that allows players to teleport using
teleporters and waypoints. It functions entirely without commands and
is compatible with permissions.

Installation is very simple. Simply download ModePoints.jar, add it to your
plugins folder, and reload your plugins. Vault is required for Permissions to
function. If Vault is detected, ModePoints will automatically switch to using
Permissions. Simply give your users the permission "modepoints.use".

If at any point this plugin falls into a state of disrepair, feel free to contact
me and ask for an update. Bug reports are always appreciated. Suggestions are
also welcome; however this plugin was designed to be simple, so extravagant
suggestions will likely be denied or ignored.

The license above, as you may have guessed, it mostly a joke. I do not care
what you do with this software, under the condition that you do not try
to legally prosecute me for stealing "your" code.

With that said, have fun!
